## Data analytics projects

### Introduction

This repository is mainly for projects I have completed under Associate Data Analyst Programme to exhibit the proficiency in data analytics including blending historical data from various sources, processing data cleaning and transformation, and performing analysis through the usage of development tools to generate reports and dashboards to support business and product decisions with actionable insights and critical findings.

### Project 1

Machine learning and advanced analytics using Python
- To derive and achieve a higher accuracy level in predicting the probabilities of default rate through the use of various machine learning algorithms, in order to better reduce the default rate and further minimise credit risk exposed to Lenders 
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Data Analysis using Visualizations
- Creating Machine learning models and evaluating performance
- Utilising data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, Scikit learn)
 
### Project 2

Data visualization with Power BI
- US Small Business Administration (SBA) Loan analytics- To review the internal lending guidelines for small-medium enterprises under commercial banking in order to better handle and minimise default risk and to have their resources allocated more efficiently 
- Performing aata analysis and creating interactive dashboard in PowerBI
- Communicating data driven insights with Credit risk management of the bank

### Project 3

Analyse data with SQL and Creating Interactive Dashboard and Visualization using Excel Dashboards
- To review students' performance on Virtual Learning Environment for management to make business decision on whether to have more online courses offered
- Developing Entity relationship diagram (ERD) mapping the structural diagram for the use in databse design
- To exhibit the 5 stages of the data lifecycle (frame, prepare, analyse, interpret, communicate) through the use of SQL and MS Excel
- Creating tables in databse and performing ETL with SQL to have a clearer overview 
- Creating dashboard in MS Excel and delivering actionable insights to the management of the organisation
