## Data analytics projects

### Introduction

This repository is mainly for projects I have completed under Associate Data Analyst Programme. 

To exhibit the 5 stages of data lifecycle through the use of various tools on the dataset provide:
Frame- Data collection and importing the data
Prepare- Data preparation, data cleaning and data transformation
Analyse- Data analysis using visualizations
Interpret- Creating Interactive Dashboard
Communicate- Communicating insights derived to the Stakeholders


analysing raw data to reveal trends and metrics in order to optimise processes and increase the overall efficiency of a business.

data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects.
