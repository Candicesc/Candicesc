## Data analytics projects

### Introduction

This repository is mainly for projects I have completed under Associate Data Analyst Programme. 

data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. 

I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as I build a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.
